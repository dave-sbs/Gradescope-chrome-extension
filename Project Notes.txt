TODO
1. Search only within the 'main' section
2. Make search much faster

Task 1
- Get the question list - 1 HOUR - DONE
    - Technically Johnny only needs an array of the actual questions. He doesn't need the div elements
    - But I will need to store the list with the divs in some array because I will have to change them later. Don't want to repopulate the array.

Task 2
-
